# YDL
# Youtube Donwloader L

Simple and minimal youtube downloader based on youtube-dl.
Anyone can use the code with or without permission till they include the reference to "Youtube-dl" license agreement.


Conversion on x86_64 processor (Intel x86_x64) failes because of some text reallocation in binaries of FFMPEG, so if you own any mobile device having these processors, you are on your own for the purpose of conversion of DASH video and DASH audio.


# TODO
1. DASH Audio and DASH video merger
2. UI optimizations
3. Creation of Settings Activity for setting Default Directory and number of threads to download the file
4. Creation of Custom download manager, instead of using third party lib
~~5. Support for Intel x86_64 processor for the purpose of converion and merger of file (No-Priority)~~
